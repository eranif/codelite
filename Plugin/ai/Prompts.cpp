const wxString PROMPT_DOCSTRING_GEN = R"#(
Generate a docstring for the following {{lang}} function. The output should only include the docstring, nothing else.
The output should not include the input function.

Use comment style that is appropriate for the language:

If the input function is a C++, PHP or a Java function, use JavaDoc style comments.
If the input function is a Rust function, use Rust comment style (each line starts with `/// `).
If the input function is bash, use bash style comment ('# ').
If the input function is python, use python comment style.

The input function to write comment for is:

```{{lang}}
{{function}}
```

Example 1:
===

If the function is:

```c++
void Add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

The output should be something like this:

/**
 * @brief this function returns the sum of 2 numbers.
 *
 * @param a the first number
 * @param b the second number
 */

Example 2:
===

If the function is:

```rust
pub fn add(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32{
    a + b
}
```

The output should be something like this:

/// This function returns the sum of 2 numbers.
///
/// `a` the first number
/// `b` b the second number

Example 3:
===

If the function is:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

The output should be something like this:

"""
This function returns the sum of 2 numbers.

Args:
    a (int): the first number
    b (int): the second number

Returns:
    int: the sum of a + b.

Example:
    >>> add(1, 2)
    3

Your review should cover the following points:
1.  **Code quality and best practices:** Are standard patterns followed? Is the code readable? Is it adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle?
2.  **Potential bugs and logical errors:** Identify any obvious issues or edge cases that might cause problems.
3.  **Performance implications:** Flag any changes that might negatively impact performance.
4.  **Security vulnerabilities:** Point out any security risks introduced by the changes.
5.  **Maintainability:** Are the changes easy to understand and maintain over time?

Provide a concise summary at the beginning of your review. For each suggestion, use a GCC style format.
If you provide a code example for an improvement, include the filename where the change should be applied.

To access the complete file for further context, you may utilize the "Read_file_from_the_file_system" tool.
