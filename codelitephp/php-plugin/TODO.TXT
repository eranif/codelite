Code Completion / Code Generation
=================================

- PHP 7: support: function return types
    
    function foobar() : int {
        return 1.0;
    }
    
- PHP 7: support: function arguments type hints:
    
    function foobar(int $a, int $b) : int {
        return $a + $b;
    }
    
- code completion: better comment for ctor/dtor functions
- code completion: add ctor function calltip... (its annoying!) NOTE: __construct is not called by default. Only the child __construct should be called
- When typing inside 'require{_once}' auto complete file names
- SFTP: add a per file destination folder to allow overriding the global settings
- Better parsing for functions' return value

Usability:
==========
- Open resource dialog: by default, list there a list of recently opened files
- Function calltip should include the return value
- Allow user to define a deployment folder for his files 
  (in addition to the SFTP, it should also allow user to copy files by simply saving them)
- Add support for laravel wizard
- Fix nav bar for PHP plugin

NICE TO HAVE: 
- XDebug watches
