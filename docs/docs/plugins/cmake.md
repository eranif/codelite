## Creating a CMake-based project
---

### Quick start

Creating a `CMake` based project is the same process as described in the [Quick Start Guide](../hello_world.md#hello-world-program)
with one change: under the `Build System` drop down, choose `CMake`

Now, when opening the project settings dialog, you will notice the under `General` &#8594; `Makefile Generator` the option selected is `CMake`

### Building

With `CMake` based project, you should see 3 new entries for the project context menu:

- `Run CMake`
- `Export CMakeList.txt`
- `Open CMakeLists.txt`

To get the build started, select the option `Run CMake` and CodeLite will generate new `CMakeLists.txt` file and will run `CMake` for it

You should see output similar to this:

```batch
C:\CMake\bin\cmake.exe C:\Users\Eran\Desktop\Test\CMakeTest  -G"MinGW Makefiles"
-- The C compiler identification is GNU 7.3.0
-- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 7.3.0
-- Check for working C compiler: C:/compilers/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe
-- Check for working C compiler: C:/compilers/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe -- works
-- Detecting C compiler ABI info
-- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done
-- Detecting C compile features
-- Detecting C compile features - done
-- Check for working CXX compiler: C:/compilers/mingw64/bin/g++.exe
-- Check for working CXX compiler: C:/compilers/mingw64/bin/g++.exe -- works
-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info
-- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done
-- Detecting CXX compile features
-- Detecting CXX compile features - done
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: C:/Users/Eran/Desktop/Test/CMakeTest/cmake-build-Debug/CMakeTest
==== Done ====
```

Now you are ready to build your project, by simply clicking ++f7++
and you should get an output similar to this:

```batch
cd C:\Users\Eran\Desktop\Test\CMakeTest\cmake-build-Debug\CMakeTest && C:/compilers/mingw64/bin/mingw32-make.exe -j24 SHELL=cmd.exe -e
Scanning dependencies of target CMakeTest

[100%] Linking CXX executable ..\output\CMakeTest.exe
[100%] Built target CMakeTest
====0 errors, 0 warnings====
```

!!! TIP
    Remember to re-run `Run CMake` whenever you are adding new files to the project


!!! TIP
    CodeLite always builds outside of the source tree in a separate folder.
    For example, for the `Debug` configuration, it will create the following build folder:
    `WORKSPACE_PATH/cmake-build-Debug` and will instruct `CMake` to place all build files there


You can customise the `CMake` command from the project settings dialog, under `General` &#8594; `Makefile Generator` &#8594; `Arguments`

For example: in order to enable `Debug` build with a custom `C++` compiler, you can set this in the `Arguments` field:

```cmake
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/gcc/gcc-10
```

## Customise
---

At the top of the generated `CMakeList.txt` file, you will find this line:

```cmake
# -*- CMakeLists.txt generated by CodeLite IDE. Do not edit by hand -*-
```

The existence of the above line in **each** of the workspace `CMakeLists.txt` files, is an indication that these files
were generated by CodeLite and it safe to overwrite them.

In other words: if you wish to manually edit the files without having them regenerated each time by CodeLite, remove these lines


### Adding user code to a generated `CMakeLists.txt`

Even though you can take ownership of the `CMakeLists.txt` by removing the header line, it is convenient to have them
updated automatically by CodeLite.

Luckily, CodeLite offers another way to edit generated `CMakeLists.txt` files without having your modifications removed.

For example, let's have a look at a generated `CMakeLists.txt` file:


```cmake
# -*- CMakeLists.txt generated by CodeLite IDE. Do not edit by hand -*-

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.11)

project(CMakeProject)

# Define some variables
set(PROJECT_PATH "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/CMakeProject")

#{{{{ User Code 1
# Place your code here
#}}}}

include_directories(
    .
)

# Compiler options
add_definitions(-g)
add_definitions(-O0)
add_definitions(-Wall)

# Linker options

# Library path
set(CMAKE_LDFLAGS "${CMAKE_LDFLAGS} -L. ")

# Define the CXX sources
set ( CXX_SRCS
    ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/CMakeProject/main.cpp
)

set_source_files_properties(
    ${CXX_SRCS} PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS
    " -g -O0 -Wall")

#{{{{ User Code 2
# Place your code here
#}}}}

add_executable(CMakeProject ${CXX_SRCS} ${C_SRCS})
target_link_libraries(CMakeProject ${LINK_OPTIONS})

#{{{{ User Code 3
# Place your code here
#}}}}
```

There are 3 blocks marked with `#{{{{ User Code 1`, `#{{{{ User Code 2` and `#{{{{ User Code 3` These blocks are placed at the top,
middle and at the end of each generated `CMakeLists.txt` file.
Any code placed in these enclosed sections will remain there after regeneration of the `CMakeLists.txt`

!!! WARNING
    Removing these section markers, will cause your code to be removed next time the `CMakeLists.txt` is generated
