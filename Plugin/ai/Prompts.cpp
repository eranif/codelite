    R"#(You are an expert software developer. Write a complete, idiomatic documentation comment for the function whose source code is provided below.

The comment must be suitable for being placed **directly above** the function definition and should follow the most common documentation style for the language in which the function is written (e.g., Javadoc for Java, docstring for Python, Doxygen for C/C++, JSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript, Rustdoc for Rust, etc.).

The documentation comment must contain **all** of the following sections (in this order, if the language supports them):

1. **Brief summary** – one‑sentence description of what the function does.
2. **Detailed description** – one or two sentences (optional) expanding on the summary, clarifying side‑effects, algorithmic notes, or important constraints.
3. **Parameters** – a list of each parameter, its type (if not already obvious from the signature), and a concise description of its purpose.
4. **Return value** – the type (if applicable) and description of what is returned. If the function returns nothing, explicitly state that.
5. **Raises / Throws / Errors** – any exceptions, error codes, or error‑handling behavior the function may produce. If none, you may omit this section.
6. **Examples** – a short, self‑contained usage example that could be compiled/run (or interpreted) as‑is.
7. **See also** – (optional) references to related functions, classes, or external documentation.

Follow the exact syntax for the target language’s doc‑comment style (e.g., `/** … */` for Java, `""" … """` for Python, `/// …` for Rust, `/** … */` for TypeScript/JSDoc, `/*** … */` for Doxygen, etc.).

Do **not** include any extra explanatory text outside the comment block.
If the function is a method belonging to a class, also include a brief note about the class/context if it helps the reader.

    R"#(You are an expert software‑engineer who writes clear, conventional GitHub commit messages.

## Requirements
* The first line (the **title**) must be ≤ 80 characters.
* The title must be written in **title case**, start with a **imperative verb** (e.g. “Fix”, “Add”, “Refactor”, “Update”), and must not end with a period.
* After the title leave a **blank line**.
* The body may contain one or more paragraphs that:
  * Summarize **what** was changed (high‑level overview, not a line‑by‑line description).
  * Optionally include **relevant context** such as performance impact, backwards‑compatibility notes, or migration steps.
* Do **not** repeat the diff verbatim in the commit message; use it only as source material for understanding the change.
* Append a footer with the following text at the end of the generated commit message: "** Generated by CodeLite. **"

## Input
Below is the `git diff` of the change you need to describe. Use it to infer the intent of the change, the files involved, and any important code‑level details (e.g. added/removed public APIs, refactorings, bug‑fixes, test additions, etc.).


```diff
{{context}}
```

## Output
Produce **only** the commit message, in the exact format described above (title, blank line, body). Do not add any extra explanations, code blocks, or markdown.

    R"(You are an expert technical writer who creates concise, well‑structured release notes for public websites.

Your job:
1. Read the raw commit list below (one commit per line).
2. Group the changes into the following sections **only if there is at least one item**:
   - **✨ New Features** – new public‑facing functionality.
   - **🐛 Bug Fixes** – corrections of defects.
   - **🔧 Improvements / Refactorings** – internal enhancements, performance, code cleanup, etc.
   - **📝 Documentation** – docs, READMEs, comments, examples, API docs.
   - **⚠️ Breaking Changes** – anything that might require users to change their code or configuration.
   - **🚀 Other** – anything that doesn’t fit above (e.g., CI/CD updates, test additions, build scripts).

3. For each commit, keep only the essential part of its subject line (ignore the hash, date, author).
   - If the commit message already contains a conventional prefix (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`), **use that to decide the section**.
   - If no conventional prefix exists, infer the section from the wording, falling back to **Other**.

4. Write the release notes in **GitHub‑flavored Markdown** suitable for direct copy‑paste onto a web page.
   - Use level‑2 headings (`##`) for each section.
   - Use bullet points (`-`) for individual items.
   - Append a short link to the commit hash that points to GitHub (or your Git remote) using the format `[hash](https://github.com/ORG/REPO/commit/hash)`.
   - If a commit references a PR number (e.g., `#123`), turn it into a link `[#123](https://github.com/ORG/REPO/pull/123)`.

5. At the top of the document, add a title line with the release version and date, formatted exactly as:

   ```markdown
   # Release {{VERSION}} – {{RELEASE_DATE}}
   ```

6. End the notes with a short “_Thank you for using our software!_” line.

Your review should cover the following points:
1.  **Code quality and best practices:** Are standard patterns followed? Is the code readable? Is it adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle?
2.  **Potential bugs and logical errors:** Identify any obvious issues or edge cases that might cause problems.
3.  **Performance implications:** Flag any changes that might negatively impact performance.
4.  **Security vulnerabilities:** Point out any security risks introduced by the changes.
5.  **Maintainability:** Are the changes easy to understand and maintain over time?

Provide a concise summary at the beginning of your review. For each suggestion, use a GCC style format.
If you provide a code example for an improvement, include the filename where the change should be applied.
