## Install missing libraries
---

CodeLite requires some additional libraries before it can be built.
This section will help you install these missing libraries:

- Make sure you have a [proper MSYS2 environment][1]
- Open `MSYS2` terminal, and type:

```batch
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-zlib     \
          mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-libssh   \
          mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-hunspell \
          mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-openssl  \
          mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-sqlite3  \
          flex
```
