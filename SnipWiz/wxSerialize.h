    \mainpage

    This is the wxSerialize documentation guide. wxSerialize is a serializing class meant for serializing / de-serializing
	a complete (or partial) object model to a stream. The streaming is made type safe and reliable. This means when an
	error occurs (wrong data read back or unexpected end of file) the wxSerialize class logs an error, and refuses to
	read from the stream, leaving all variables that follow the error untouched, or in a default state.

	With the use of a version number and a header, the stream is checked when reading it back. When, for example you
	wrote a stream with version 1000, and upon reading you expect version 900, the wxSerialize class logs an error that
	the expected version is lower then the encountered version, avoiding a mis-read of data that is not supported in the
	code. With the use of a header string, you can double check if the stream offered is really recognised by the
	application.

	Because wxSerialize uses wxInputStream and wxOutputStream for reading and writing, the contents of the serialization
	can be written to a memory based stream, a compression stream (like wxZLibOutputStream), a tcp/ip socket, from
	an wxURL (from the internet, handy for updates), or any other stream based upon wxInputStream / wxOutputStream.

	The streaming is binary compatible on Linux / Windows and MacOSX which means that if you read back the binary data
	from disk, the same results are read back, the values are properly converted from little to big endian.

	\section serializing_exactly Ok but what is serializing exactly?

	Serializing is putting the contents of a class to an output file. Microsoft's MFC used CArchive (which I attempted
	to keep as API compatible as possible) and boost now also has a binary serializer. So, how does it work? Well it
	is really simple. The power of the serializing lies in the fact that the classes themselves are responsible for
	serializing their data. It is very short in code, and the destination of the serialization stream doesn't really
	matter.

    \section how_work So how does it work?

	Consider the following class:

	\code
	class MyDataClass
	{
	public:
		// the serialization class, that streams from and to the
		// specified stream.
		Serialize(wxSerialize &a);

	private:
		wxString m_name;
		wxString m_address;
		wxUint8 m_age;
		wxArrayString m_siblings;
	};
	\endcode
	How does the serializing work .. We simply implement the Serialize method:
	\code
	bool MyDataClass::Serialize(wxSerialize &a)
	{
		if(a.IsStoring())
		{
			a << m_name << m_address << m_age;
			a << m_siblings;
		}
		else
		{
			a >> m_name >> m_address >> m_age;
			a >> m_siblings;
		}

		// return false when the archive encountered an error
		return a.IsOk();
	}
	\endcode

	This is all there is to it! This small piece of code, serializes the 4 used member vars to the stream, on disk
	or where it needs to go. The following code shows how the class is serialized. First when it is saved to disk:

	\code
	wxFileOutputStream file("somefile.dat");
	wxSerialize a(file);

	m_ourClass->Serialize(a);
	\endcode

	That's all! When the file and archive are out of scope, the file is closed and the object is persistent on disk.
	Now to read the data back:

	\code
	wxFileInputStream file("somefile.dat");
	wxSerialize a(file);

	// let's say we just create it and initialize it
	m_ourClass = new MyDataClass();
	m_ourClass->Serialize(a);
	\endcode

	Nearly identical code isn't it ? Even the new MyDataClass() is not needed, it is simply there to illustrate how
	newly created objects can be serialized back into. Only one method is needed, I called it Serialize() but the
	name does not matter.

	\section why_using So why not write using wxConfig, wxFFile, XML or use XTI?

	This serializer class was designed, keeping in mind a small footprint in memory and disk. When serializing to XML
	you gain flexibility and even can hand-edit it, but the overhead in the class is enormous. You have to figure out
	how the data needs to be stored, attribute names, nested hierarchies, handle errors, etc. XML is basically better
	to write to, if user editing or portability is a big issue.

	Serializing to a binary file can be more useful in the following situations:

	- Writing cache data (e.g. an object model that represents a state in memory). By writing this in a serialized
	  stream to disk, the object model can be quickly read back between sessions, or heavy preprocessing (e.g storing
	  a directory structure to disk) can be avoided.
	- Undo / Redo mechanism. Usually undo / redo mechanisms require a lot of overhead in the object model. For example
	  when the user deletes a data item in a GUI window, this item should not be really deleted, only taken apart from the
	  object model. When using a serializer class, the object can be removed, and later on re-created back on it's
	  rightful place. The good thing is that the serialize methods can both handle undo / redo, but also save the
	  data to disk.
    - Small applications that do not require overhead of XML, SQL, or use wxConfig because these all need name / value
	  conventions. With very small applications that only perform minor tasks, the developer is more distracted by
	  the writing to disk then it's really needed.
    - Writing config. This sounds odd, but when you have a global config object, and it is not really necessary to
	  keep all that data in a text file, serializing the object containing the config is rather easy.

	So when is it not useful?

	- Ofcourse when people want to edit the data afterwards.
	- When the data needs to be exchanged between applications using a standard format
	- When the application needs to process huge data, or store entered data on disk to be queried later on (SQL or
	  XML).

    \section what_dp What about data flexibility?

	People who spent some time serializing data, know that when for example a binary serialized file is written to disk
	and the object is extended with more data, you have a problem with serializing it back.
	Why? The data in the stream is only compatible with the old data makeup, and when adding new member vars how are
	you going to read them back? They are not in the stream to begin with, and you don't even know if they are or not.
	Well I deviced two ways of doing this. Let's for example extend our rather trivial MyDataClass class:

	\code
	class MyDataClass
	{
	public:
		// the serialization class, that streams from and to the
		// specified stream.
		Serialize(wxSerialize &a);

	private:
		wxString m_name;
		wxString m_address;
		wxUint8 m_age;
		wxArrayString m_siblings;

		// NEW DATA ADDED, THIS NEEDS SERIALIZING TOO!
		wxUint32 m_monthlyPay;
		bool m_healthInsurance;
	};
	\endcode


	\subsection version_number Using a version number

	The version number you can give to the stream when you write it back. This version number is stored and checked upon
	reading. When creating the stream you specify the version of the stream. You increment this version when there will
	be binary incompatibility with older streams:

	\code
	wxFileOutputStream file("somefile.dat");	
	wxSerialize a(file, 1001);   // latest version is 1001 (was 1000)

	m_ourClass->Serialize(a);
	\endcode

	Now in the code we can take this in account when reading. When we save, we simply save our new data back. And
	as you guessed the drawback, older applications still in the field cannot read the newer stream:

	\code
	bool MyDataClass::Serialize(wxSerialize &a)
	{
		if(a.IsStoring())
		{
			// simply write all
			a << m_name << m_address << m_age;
			a << m_siblings;

			// always append new data here, so reading back goes in
			// the same exact order as it is written
			a << m_monthlyPay << m_healthInsurance;
		}
		else
		{
			a >> m_name >> m_address >> m_age;
			a >> m_siblings;

			// reading back poses a problem. We can have the data but in
			// an older stream we have not. So we need the version check:
			if(a.GetVersion() > 1000)
			{
				a >> m_monthlyPay >> m_healthInsurance;
			}
		}

		// return false when the archive encountered an error
		return a.IsOk();
	}
	\endcode

	As you might have guessed, this can be some overhead. While developing the app, this can happen a lot
	as the classes grow. So the disadvantages are:

	- Older releases you wrote (and are in the field) cannot read the newer data back. So when you use serialization
	  as part of packages or updates, people are obliged to update, or you must provide multiple versions)
	- All the newer data require a version check at read time, and will bloat your application as you must take in
	  account all older streams. A small overhead, but lots of changes will simply bloat your code with GetVersion()
	  checks which is not really elegant.

	\subsection enter_leave Using EnterObject() and LeaveObject()

	To reduce the code overhead, and maintain binary read compatiblity between older and newer releases of your
	application, I deviced a way which allows you to add member data to your serializing routines and not break
	the reading of older or even newer streams. This is how it works;

	\code
	bool MyDataClass::Serialize(wxSerialize &a)
	{
		a.EnterObject();
		if(a.IsStoring())
		{
			// simply write all
			a << m_name << m_address << m_age;
			a << m_siblings;
			a << m_monthlyPay << m_healthInsurance;
		}
		else
		{
			a >> m_name >> m_address >> m_age;
			a >> m_siblings;
			a >> m_monthlyPay >> m_healthInsurance;
		}
		a.LeaveObject();

		return a.IsOk();
	}
	\endcode

	Done! These two powerful boundaries (EnterObject() and LeaveObject()) tackle two situations:

	-	<b>Reading an old stream in a newer application</b>. So what happens, when for example the older stream does not contain the
		m_monthlyPay and m_healthInsurance, the LeaveObject() boundary was already written in the old code. The stream
		recognises this, and refuses to read data into m_monthlyPay and m_healthInsurance. In these cases the default
		value will be kept in these members. Data that follows after the boundary when LeaveObject was not called,
		will be kept default.
    -	<b>Reading a newer stream with an older application</b>. When the application you released in the field is older then the stream
		being written by the newer release, more data is present in the stream then the old application knows about.
		Here the same situation applies. The LeaveObject() in the old code comes sooner then the expected leave boundary
		in the stream, so wxSerialize will go look for the boundary and ignore all data that is newer.

	The EnterObject() and LeaveObject() construction keeps the stream in sync. The only important thing to remember is
	that you MUST USE these boundaries from the first moment and not when you are adding new member objects later on.
	It is a small sacrifice to gain a lot of flexibility! The overhead in the stream is also very small, because the
	footprint of the boundaries is exactly 1 byte for the enter and 1 byte for the leave marker.

	EnterObject() and LeaveObject() can be used multiple times after eachother, and also nested. So when you serialize
	a class hierarchy and in one of your child objects also data changes, this will be possible.

	The only drawback that is left with this approach (but is also present in <b>all</b> data writing when older applications
	write back data that contained newer information) is that newer data is being overwritten. You must take special
	caution (for example using the version tag or wxSerializeStatus object) in your application to warn the user that
	the data being written will destroy newer information in the serializing stream. The newer release of your
	application can still read this stream, but newer data is defaulted again.

    Also another caveat is that when you replace data being read back it will not work, not with EnterObject() / 
    LeaveObject() but also not with a versioned stream. Consider this example:

	\code
	bool MyDataClass::Serialize(wxSerialize &a)
	{
		a.EnterObject();
		if(a.IsStoring())
		{
			// simply write all
			a << m_name << m_address << m_age;
			a << m_siblings; 
            //a << m_monthlyPay << m_healthInsurance;
            // REPLACED NOW with:
            a << m_surName << m_middleName;
		}
		else
		{
			a >> m_name >> m_address >> m_age;
			a >> m_siblings;
			// WON'T WORK! In older versions the two vars m_monthlypay and m_healthInsurance
            // were stored here, instead we read back this. If the stream we read back do not
            // contain these new replaced variables yet, we are hitting an error state. 
            a >> m_surName >> m_middleName;
		}
		a.LeaveObject();

		return a.IsOk();
	}
	\endcode 

	\subsection archive_status wxSerializeStatus Helper Class

	This class is especially designed to keep the status of the stream between reading and writing. It contains the
	last version being written or read, the header, and more important, an NewDataLoss() flag. This flag will be set
	when the stream being read back is newer then the data model it's beaing serialized into. Writing the data back
	using the wxSerializeStatus object earlier retrieved when reading will prevent the write if the flag NewDataLoss()
	is not reset using OverwriteNew() flag. How is the flag determined? Well, if one time in the data serializing
	process the LeaveObject() method needs to search for the marker (thus skipping newer data in the stream) this
	flag is set.

	This wxSerializeStatus class will also remove the need of writing the same header back as being specified when
	reading, and also the version will be preserved. The member wxSerializeStatus::SetVersion() can be used to specify
	a newer version. Here is an example, first when reading we store the last status and keep it:

	\code
	wxFileInputStream file("somefile.dat");
	wxSerialize a(file);

	// let's say we just create it and initialize it
	m_ourClass = new MyDataClass();
	m_ourClass->Serialize(a);

	// store the status (copy class)
	m_ourStatus = a.GetArchiveStatus();
	\endcode

	When writing back, and this application is older then the newer application, thus an overwrite will result
	in newer information loss:


	\code
	// if the last time we read a newer stream, tell the user
	if(m_ourStatus.NewDataLoss())
	{
		if(::wxMessageDialog( ... "ask if we should overwrite, it will result in dataloss" ...) == wxID_YES)
			m_ourStatus.OverwriteNew();	// reset the flag
	}

	// if the flag is reset we continue else we skip
	if(!m_ourStatus.NewDataLoss())
	{
		wxFileOutputStream file("somefile.dat");
		wxSerialize a(file, m_ourStatus.GetVersion(), m_ourStatus.GetHeader());
		// serialize data
		m_ourClass->Serialize(a);
	}
	else
	{
		wxLogError("Data is not saved!");
	}
	\endcode

	This construction prevents the application of accidentally writing data back and destroying newer serialized data.
	The user must explicitly agree upon this, or the developer must provide a mechanism to backup the old file so that
	newer data is not lost when reading it back in the newer application.
*/

public:
    /** Construct an input stream archive. The stream will be used to retrieve the data from, which can be any
		derived stream like a file, zip stream etc. When constructed as input, the wxSerialize object cannot
		be written to.

        The first integer and string are always read from the stream. This contains the version number (or 0 when
		not used) and the header which is empty if not used.

        When setting the version parameter, wxSerialize will check if the version read back is at least the expected
		version. For example, when version argument is set to 1000, wxSerialize will accept versions 0 .. 1000 for reading
		but will give an error if version 1001 and up is read from the stream. You can use this to set the version to
        at least the supported version for your code. When extending the serialization routines after your app has
		been deployed, the version info can be used to dynamically skip parts while loading from an older stream,
		and warn users that the version of the read stream is older which means incompatibility with
        the older application will occur. This is not the recommended method though, see EnterObject() and LeaveObject()
		for a more flexible solution.

        The header tag will also be compared when it is not empty. When an empty header is passed as parameter, the read
		back header tag is ignored. When the header argument is set, and the read back header is empty or different,
		an error will occur and the stream cannot be read back from. This can provide an extra check if the stream
		will contain the data needed.

        The partialMode flag will do nothing else but setting a flag (IsFullSerialize()) which can be used in
		serializing to skip some relational hierarchies and stuff not needed when the object is only partially
		serialized to the stream (handy for undo / redo mechanisms). When set to true, IsFullSerialize() will
		return false.

        \code

		See also \ref enter_leave and read about data flexibility.

        The version (1000 in example) is saved in the stream, also the header. At reading time these two are checked
		against what the expected version and header are, so that you can be sure the stream is recognised and
		supported.

        Always save your latest supported version here. This means when you extended your application's serialization,
		increment the version. This will allow you to read back older streams and save them with newer information.

					a.ReadInt(m_peopeCount, 0);	// default no people when not present
					a.ReadUint8(m_numberOfPersons, 1);	// default 1 person
