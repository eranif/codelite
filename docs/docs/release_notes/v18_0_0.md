## Changes

---

- Windows Installer updated
- CodeLite now uses 2 top level toolbars:
    - Main toolbar, a native one. Placed on the LEFT by default. This can be changed from the `View` menu
    - Generic one for the plugins (placed on the second row)
- All images are loaded from SVG files
- git plugin: by default, disable the "Commit" info in the navigation bar
- File System Workspace: when launching an executable, use terminal
- Source code formatter: added support for `cmake-format` (doc updated for how to install it)
- Registered `CMake` as a language in CodeLite and associate it with the file type `TypeCMake`
- Windows: MSYS2 is now located using the registry entries first
- Aligned wxCrafter version with CodeLite's one
- Updated CodeLite icon
- Rust compiler: collect crate paths (as reported by cargo during the build) to properly open files with errors (these files paths are reported relative to the crate's Cargo.toml file)
- Language Server: do not fire a code completion request when typing inside a comment or string
- Preferences Dialog: Add missing translations (**rlbxku1r**)
- Update `codelite.pot` (**rlbxku1r**)
- Update Japanese translation (**rlbxku1r**)
- Language Server: optimized the chatter between CodeLite and the LSP:
    - Only ask for semantic tokens when the file is loaded or saved
    - Instead of sending the full file content to server each time a reparse is needed, send the incremental diff (`vector<TextDocumentContentChangeEvent>`)
    - moved CodeLite log file location into a separate folder
    - Fixed `LSP::Range` serialisation to JSON
- Language Server:
    - Removed the "priority field"
    - Allow the user to add custom `initializationOptions` (per the spec)
- Dropped support for `RLS` language server (was deprecated in favour of `rust-analyzer`)
- Language Server:
    - Support `cmake-language-server` auto detection (docs updated)
    - fixed: sometimes, the lsp report back with lower case file paths on Windows.

- source code formatter: when a command is not found, disable the formatter by default
- SSH session: allow the user to change the SSH behaviour by providing the following 3 environment variables:
    - `SSH_OPTIONS_KEY_EXCHANGE`: Set the key exchange method to be used (string, comma-separated list). ex: `ecdh-sha2-nistp256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`
    - `SSH_OPTIONS_HOSTKEYS`: Set the preferred server host key types (string, comma-separated list). ex: `ssh-rsa,ssh-dss,ecdh-sha2-nistp256`
    - `SSH_OPTIONS_PUBLICKEY_ACCEPTED_TYPES`: Set the preferred public key algorithms to be used for authentication (string, comma-separated list). ex: `ssh-rsa,rsa-sha2-256,ssh-dss,ecdh-sha2-nistp256`

- C++ version required by CodeLite is now C++17
- CodeLite no longer requires `ssh` terminal to execute remote commands. It now uses `ssh_channel` from `libssh`

- [Language Server: support `workspace/codeActions`. A code action are fixes suggested by the language server. An example for a C++ code action: added missing include header or add missing `;` etc][18]
- Language Server: detect broken paths in configured LSPs and prompt the user with a fix-it button
- CppCheck plugin: use the system installed cppcheck tool instead of installing an old version with CodeLite

- Status bar: added 2 buttons on the left side of the status bar for quick showing/hiding the sidebar / bottom bar
- UI redesign: the sidebar is now a new "button like" control. An additional "secondary sidebar" was added. User can move items from the primary sidebar to the secondary
- Status bar: added a "show secondary sidebar" button
- Linux: the IDE is now built using the generic notebook control (changes in wxWidgets no longer allows us to maintain our custom book control)

- Main editor tab control is now using a subclass of wxAuiNotebook. This allows the user to place tabs side by side by simply dragging them
- `clangd` detector: the `--limit-results` flag now uses the value set by the user in `settings -> code completion -> number of items to display`
- Code completion box: when there is exactly one match in the code completion box, and it matches what the user already written in the editor -> dismiss the box
- Code completion help window: wait 250ms before attempting to display it,
    this reduces the CPU cycles when quickly moving items in the code completion box

## Bug fixes

---

- [Subclass of wxSpinCtrl crashes wxCrafter][1]
- Fixed: find in files: exclude patterns are not always working
- wxCrafter: removed the `wxTRANSPARENT_WINDOW` style (it was changed to `0` in wxWidgets, that caused it to looks like it is always enabled in the UI)
- Language Server: in case the lsp command does not exist, disable it (better than the alternative: crashing CodeLite)
- [latest master build fails with assertion dialog during startup][2]
- [Support horizontal scrolling in the various tree/list controls in CodeLite][3]
- [always use `mkdir -p` (which should be available on platforms)][4]
- Fixed: windows GDI objects leak
- Before opening SSH session, apply the environment variables
- more assertion fixes with debug builds of wxWidgets
- [Outline view does not work][6]
- [cancel calltip + cc box when the editor is losing the focus][7]
- [support importing alacritty colour themes into CodeLite][8]
- [Run (CTRL+F5 shortcut) won't work after Build (F7 shortcut) in version 17.1.0][9]
- [Remember last scroll position in code tabs][10]
- ['Trim only modified lines' checkbox UI problem][11]
- [restore the save/save-all toolbar buttons][12]
- fixed: Alacritty terminal not working on macOS
- fixed: When repeatedly launching processes, the environment variables might grow until a point where `execvp()` returns with `E2BIG` and eventually crashing CodeLite

- fixed: git console "Add file" & "Reset file" are now enabled based on the list state
- Fixed: git plugin should now be disabled when there is no active git repository
- Fixed: git console buttons: "Add file" & "Reset file" not working
- Fixed: remote language servers started by CodeLite, now honour the `env` field of the `codelite-remote.json` file
- fixed: file system workspace: properly restore the session after load
- fixed: [CodeLite loses focus when build completes][15]
- fixed: [CodeLite crash if home directory contains non ASCII chars][16]
- [simplify the auto-indent when ENTER is hit after "public" keyword][19]
- When closing the last tab in the editor, clear the window frame title
- [Fixed: Removing file(s) in Workspace View also removes deselected files, wrong dialog, bad spelling...][23]
- [fixed: Bug/Regression: Left-click on ruler to place a break-point shows right-click popup menu instead][24]
- [Fixed: RXVT terminal: support multiple executable options (`rxvt-unicode`, `rxvt` and `urxvt`)][25]

- Rust (remoty) - do not attempt to guess the current working directory, just use the workspace path as the root
- [CppCheck crash][32]
- [On Windows, use native toolbar for the side bar control][33]
- Fixed: editor flickers after foramtter execution
- SpellChecker: instead of parsing the line based on position, use Line + Col approach - this way, if we have offset error, it will only affect the current line
  dnd the offset error will not get carried over to the next line.
- SpellChecker: use `UTF8Lengh()` method to calculate real length of tokens, this should fix problems when using non ASCII chars in the document
  and the spelling error marker does not correctly mark the word
- [Language Server Diagnostics are not shown anymore since 17.9.0][34]
- Fixed: spellchecker highlights sometimes are not aligned with the editor text

- Fixed: when the function arguments tip window shows, skip the first argument if it is "self" (e.g. for class method in `Python` or `Rust`)
- Fixed: when LSP tries to place many markers ("diagnostics") on the editor, it causes an excessive reads from the disk which can cause a noticable lag
- Editor navigation bar: remove the "bookmark" button (it causes too much extra work for CodeLite with no real benefit)
- Fixed: Rust: the configuration option "Hitting ENTER in a C++ comment adds '//'" does not work Removed un-needed log line entry
- Navigation control (Ctrl-Tab popup window) is now centered on CodeLite, regardless of its parent book
- [Fixed: closing a modified tab on Linux / macOS causes to lose modified changes][35]
- Fixed: some LSPs return completions that start with a ".", remove it before inserting it
- Fixed: Crashes and lockups when parsing PHP projects
