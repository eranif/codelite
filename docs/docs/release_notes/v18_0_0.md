## Changes

---

- Windows Installer updated
- CodeLite now uses 2 top level toolbars:
    - Main toolbar, a native one. Placed on the LEFT by default. This can be changed from the `View` menu
    - Generic one for the plugins (placed on the second row)
- All images are loaded from SVG files
- git plugin: by default, disable the "Commit" info in the navigation bar
- File System Workspace: when launching an executable, use terminal
- Source code formatter: added support for `cmake-format` (doc updated for how to install it)
- Registered `CMake` as a language in CodeLite and associate it with the file type `TypeCMake`
- Windows: MSYS2 is now located using the registry entries first
- Aligned wxCrafter version with CodeLite's one
- Updated CodeLite icon
- Rust compiler: collect crate paths (as reported by cargo during the build) to properly open files with errors (these files paths are reported relative to the crate's Cargo.toml file)
- Language Server: do not fire a code completion request when typing inside a comment or string
- Preferences Dialog: Add missing translations (**rlbxku1r**)
- Update `codelite.pot` (**rlbxku1r**)
- Update Japanese translation (**rlbxku1r**)
- Language Server: optimized the chatter between CodeLite and the LSP:
    - Only ask for semantic tokens when the file is loaded or saved
    - Instead of sending the full file content to server each time a reparse is needed, send the incremental diff (`vector<TextDocumentContentChangeEvent>`)
    - moved CodeLite log file location into a separate folder
    - Fixed `LSP::Range` serialisation to JSON
- Language Server:
    - Removed the "priority field"
    - Allow the user to add custom `initializationOptions` (per the spec)
- Dropped support for `RLS` language server (was deprecated in favour of `rust-analyzer`)
- Language Server:
    - Support `cmake-language-server` auto detection (docs updated)
    - fixed: sometimes, the lsp report back with lower case file paths on Windows.

- source code formatter: when a command is not found, disable the formatter by default
- SSH session: allow the user to change the SSH behaviour by providing the following 3 environment variables:
    - `SSH_OPTIONS_KEY_EXCHANGE`: Set the key exchange method to be used (string, comma-separated list). ex: `ecdh-sha2-nistp256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`
    - `SSH_OPTIONS_HOSTKEYS`: Set the preferred server host key types (string, comma-separated list). ex: `ssh-rsa,ssh-dss,ecdh-sha2-nistp256`
    - `SSH_OPTIONS_PUBLICKEY_ACCEPTED_TYPES`: Set the preferred public key algorithms to be used for authentication (string, comma-separated list). ex: `ssh-rsa,rsa-sha2-256,ssh-dss,ecdh-sha2-nistp256`

- C++ version required by CodeLite is now C++17
- CodeLite no longer requires `ssh` terminal to execute remote commands. It now uses `ssh_channel` from `libssh`
- Colours and fonts dialog: `import` toolbar button now allows to select multiple themes to import
- Colours and fonts dialog: newly imported themes will use the global font by default
- Optimized loading of huge JSON files (`~100MB` of json file)

- Dropped support for codelite-terminal
- highlight word: remove the "HAND" cursor when hovering a highlighted word
- [Experimental: added a built-in terminal. This is not a "full blown" terminal, i.e. you can't use it to edit using `vim`. It does however, support running complex commands and support various operations][17]
- [Language Server: support `workspace/codeActions`. A code action are fixes suggested by the language server. An example for a C++ code action: added missing include header or add missing `;` etc][18]
- Language Server: detect broken paths in configured LSPs and prompt the user with a fix-it button
- CppCheck plugin: use the system installed cppcheck tool instead of installing an old version with CodeLite
- Rust editor: support keyboard for commenting / uncommenting code ( `Ctrl-/` + `Ctrl-Shift-/` )
- Rust editor: `!` is a valid word char
- source code formatter: if no formatters are configured, trigger a scan on startup
- Remote workspace + Remote SFTP view: in case of disconnection due to inactivity, attempt to reconnect
- `Ctrl-TAB` is now working for all notebooks, not only for the main editor book
- Language Server Plugin: clicking on the "Scan" button prompts the user
- Language Server Plugin: the "Scan" button now replaces all entries with what CodeLite found
- [Implemented: Show/Hide Main Toolbar][20]

- git: support using an external diff tool (e.g. winmerge, vimdiff etc)
- Debug Adapter Protocol Client (DAP): fixed issue with breakpoint not set correctly
- Debug Adapter Protocol Client (DAP): fixed bug where init para `cwd` was set to empty value when launching the server
- Debug Adapter Protocol Client (DAP): should now be working with VS Code `cpptools`
- Icons update
- LSP: rename symbol is now supported
- Remoty: reduce a remote workspace load time
- `codelite-cc` is replaced with [cc-wrapper][22]
- Status bar: added 2 buttons on the left side of the status bar for quick showing/hiding the sidebar / bottom bar
- UI redesign: the sidebar is now a new "button like" control. An additional "secondary sidebar" was added. User can move items from the primary sidebar to the secondary
- Status bar: added a "show secondary sidebar" button
- Linux: the IDE is now built using the generic notebook control (changes in wxWidgets no longer allows us to maintain our custom book control)
- Outline view: reduce the font size to be 80% of the default editor font
- Git: support "Redirect" response from server
- Zoom Navigator: the marker is now centred.

- Make the various markers (spellchecker, word highlight etc) more visible in dark themes
- Increased the git field width in the status bar
- Performance improvements
- Side bar: respond to DPI change event
- Main editor tab control is now using a subclass of wxAuiNotebook. This allows the user to place tabs side by side by simply dragging them
- `clangd` detector: the `--limit-results` flag now uses the value set by the user in `settings -> code completion -> number of items to display`
- Code completion box: when there is exactly one match in the code completion box, and it matches what the user already written in the editor -> dismiss the box
- Code completion help window: wait 250ms before attempting to display it,
    this reduces the CPU cycles when quickly moving items in the code completion box
- Get back toolbar buttons and add few new buttons (Rozhuk Ivan)
- Code completion box: allow `'` in the cc box (used by various languages like `Rust`)
- Increased  git field width in the status bar
